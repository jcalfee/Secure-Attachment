This web page works without an Internet connection.  Also, it does not contact any servers.  

The user provides a password and can then drag and drop files into this web page.  The files are immediately encrypted and kept in the browser's memory.  When the user saves the page, the encrypted files are saved to a single HTML file.  The saved HTML file will prompt for a password and then decrypt the files.

Directions are shown in the web page.

Retrieving files works best on Firefox and Chrome.

Currently drag-and-drop only works with Firefox 3.6 or newer (Safari may work too).  The browser needs to support the HTML5 file interfaces and large data URIs.  Data URIs are used to get the files back out of the web page.

Creating mailers worked on Firefox 3.6 (windows and linux).  Chrome Beta for Linux did not work.
